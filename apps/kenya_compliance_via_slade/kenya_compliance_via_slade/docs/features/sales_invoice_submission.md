## 🧾 Sales Invoice Customisation

Invoice Submission simplifies the process of submitting sales invoices, ensuring compliance. Invoices can be submitted upon finalization, either individually, in bulk, or through a background job based on the configuration in the settings. Additionally, SCU Data, including QR Codes for Sales Invoices, is generated here.
