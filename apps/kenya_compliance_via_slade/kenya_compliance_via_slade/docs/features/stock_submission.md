![Stock Submission Screenshot](../images/stock_ledger.png)

Stock-related transactions such as Stock Entries and Sales Invoices are tracked through **Stock Ledger Entries (SLE)** and submitted to **eTims** for compliance and reporting. This process is automated using a background job, with frequency and settings configurable in the **eTims Settings**.

Stock submissions are categorized into two primary processes: **Stock Adjustment** and **Stock Operations**. Each process follows a specific request flow to ensure accurate tracking, validation, and submission to **eTims**.
