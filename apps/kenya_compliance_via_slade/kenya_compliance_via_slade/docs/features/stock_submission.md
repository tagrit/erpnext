![Stock Submission Screenshot](../images/stock_ledger.png)

Stock-related transactions such as Stock Entries and Sales Invoices are tracked through **Stock Ledger Entries (SLE)** and submitted to **eTims** for compliance and reporting. This process is automated using a background job, with frequency and settings configurable in the **eTims Settings**.

Stock submissions are categorized into two primary processes: **Stock Adjustment** and **Stock Operations**. Each process follows a specific request flow to ensure accurate tracking, validation, and submission to **eTims**.

---

## **📑 Types of Requests**

### **1️⃣ Stock Adjustment**

Stock Adjustments handle inventory changes due to **Opening Stock** and **Stock Reconciliation** in ERPNext.

#### **Doctypes/Scenarios for Adjustment**

- **Opening Stock** → Initial stock setup for new items and opening stock Stock Entry.
- **Stock Reconciliation Doctype**

#### **Mapping to Locations**

- **Location** → Uses the **default warehouse** set in the system settings.

#### **Mapping Logic for ERPNext & Slade Locations**

1. **Incoming Transactions**

   - Source → **Supplier (Slade)**
   - Destination → **Default warehouse (from eTims settings)**

2. **Outgoing Transactions**
   - Source → **Default warehouse (from eTims settings)**
   - Destination → **Customer (Slade)**
